# Mailman issues - March 16

## Mails not going out to list and not appear in archive
- Mailman is probably not running, chech /var/lock/mailman for master-qrunner and master-qrunner.opm-web.1218, restart mailman *sudo service mailman restart*
- Update archives *sudo ./bin/arch opm*

## Mailman admin interface, moderator queue expected http, should be https
- My solution was to go to /usr/lib/mailman/Mailman/ -> *sudo vim mm_cfg.py*
- Change Default_URL_PATTERN = 'https://%s/cgi-bin/mailman/'
- Run *$prefix/bin/withlist -l -r fix_url opm* as root.

# User unable to subscribe (pending, not getting confirmation mails) -> qrunner not running, run $prefix /bin/mailmanctl start. 

If it is running, you will find its pid in data/master-qrunner.pid and
> >there will also be two files in locks/, one named master-qrunner and
> >containing the line
> >
> >master-qrunner.opm-web.pid

And the second named master-qrunner.opm-web.pid and having the
> >same contents where host.example.com is the actual host name and pid
> >is the actual pid of the master qrunner process.
