# Mailman issues - March 16

## Mails not going out to list and not appear in archive
- Mailman is probably not running, chech /var/lock/mailman for master-qrunner and master-qrunner.opm-web.1218, restart mailman *sudo service mailman restart*
- Update archives *sudo ./bin/arch opm*

## Mailman admin interface, moderator queue expected http, should be https
- My solution was to go to /usr/lib/mailman/Mailman/ -> *sudo vim mm_cfg.py*
- Change Default_URL_PATTERN = 'https://%s/cgi-bin/mailman/'
- Run *$prefix/bin/withlist -l -r fix_url opm* as root.
